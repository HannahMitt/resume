## Projects
[Home Mirror](https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror) A smart mirror for your home built out of a two-way mirror, an old Android tablet, and my app. It's hard to explain why, but this was pretty popular on the internet for a minute. Featured in [Popular Science magazine](http://www.popsci.com/how-to-turn-your-smartphone-into-smart-mirror).

[Nomophobia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hannah.nomophobia) The major feature of this app was a homescreen widget that would display how long it had been since you last checked your phone every time you turned your screen on. I haven't updated it since 2013 but it was pretty fun at the time.
